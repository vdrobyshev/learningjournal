# Activate web pages with JavaScript

A popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancements involves 3 components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a good idea to keep CSS and JavaScript in separate files as much as possible. 

JavaScript uses objects and methods (which can have parameters within).

\<script> invokes JavaScript. When a web browser sees script, it loads that script, which is a series of instructions.

## A Statement

A statement is an individual instruction. Each one starts on a new line and ends with ; If a  number of statements are inclosed into {}, they become code blocks.

## A Variable

A script stores its data in variables. Variables are declared with the word var followed by the name of the variable: var quantity

Variables can be of numeric, string, and boolean data types. Strings are placed inside quote marks (either single or double, as long as both the opening and closing are the same). 

When giving variables a name remember to follow the following rules:

- The name must begin with a letter, $, or _ It can't start with a number

- No - or . in the names

- No keywords or reserved words

- All variables are cases sensitive

- Use the names that describe the information stored

- If joining two words together, use camel case(ex: firstName)

# Choosing the right text editor

According to Joe Belli, text editors should be chosen based on the following critera:

1) code completion
2) syntax highlighting
3) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue 
4) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

Although every computer comes with pre-built text editors, these text editors don't have any features that make the work of developers efficient. There are a lot of factors to consider, like saving in the right folder or with the right extension. The pre-built text editors don't offer any help in editing or finding mistakes.

Joe Belli suggests using a third-party tools. He suggests the following editors:

-Notepad++

-Text Wrangler

-BB Edit

-Visual Studio Code

-Atom, Bracket

-Sublime Text

Some editors are free, some are not. Many have similar features, some have unique features. It all depends on personal preferences.

# How Computers Work

All computers have 4 things in common. They are:

- Input, It's what users do to make computers do stuff (keybords, microphones, cameras etc)
- Storage. The received information is stored in memory. 
- Processing. Computers take information from memory and manipulates it using algorithms. Then send it back to memory. CPU is resconsible for this task. 
- Output. Depends on what computers are designed to do. Could be a monitor, a display, or another computer.

Computers store information using electricity in wires using 0's and 1's (on and off). The smalest piece of information is called a bit. Binary number system allows doing more complex calculations. Any number can be represented with a series of 1s and 0s. 8 wires can represent a number between 0 and 255. 32 wires can represent over 4 billion numbers. Other types of imformation (like texts, images, and sound) can also be represented in binary. 

Every input and output is a type of information. To take input and produce a meaningful output, computers need to combine and modify input signals. Computers do it with the help of circuits. A simple cuirciut takes an electrical signal and can flip it. Depending on what combination of 0s and 1s comes in, the circuits figure out what comes out. The smaller the curcuit, the smaller distance the electrical signal has to go and the faster the device that runs this curcuit board is.

In order to process a single letter from input to output, a computer runs thousands of operations. Operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware. Operating system is also a series of commands made of binary code.

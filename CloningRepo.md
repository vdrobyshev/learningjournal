# Cloning Repo

All work published in GitHub can be organized on the local machine in Visual Studio Code. Terminal is used for that. 

Here is a list of commands to follow:

- cd ~  to make sure you are in the right directory
- mkdir <name_file> to create a file if needed
- git clone <copy_path>  Copied http address of the GitHub pages
- cd learningjournal/   to make sure you are in the right directory
- git status   can be typed at any time to check the status
- git add <file_name>  add only the files that changed
- git commit -m "Message why did what you did"
- git push original master   final steps

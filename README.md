Hi! My name is Vitaly. Nice to meet you all.

# **GROWTH MINDSET**
### Growth mindset is a learning concept that doesn't rely on talent and intelligence as the main tools in learning. Perseverance and effort are the primary requirements for successful learning. Challenges, obstacles, and mistakes are unique learning opportunities and not roadblocks. Growth mindset practitioners get inspired by success of others and learn from criticism.

*I need to remember:* 
1. No pain no gain
2. To embrace challenges
3. To Persist.

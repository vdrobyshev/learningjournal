Hi! My name is Vitaly. 

# **GROWTH MINDSET**
### Growth mindset is a learning concept that doesn't rely on talent and intelligence as the main tools in learning. Perseverance and effort are the primary requirements for successful learning. Challenges, obstacles, and mistakes are unique learning opportunities and not roadblocks. 

*I need to remember:* 
1. No pain no gain
2. To embrace challenges
3. To Persist.

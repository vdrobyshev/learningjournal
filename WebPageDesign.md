# Tips to building successful webpages

## Design

When designing a webpage, one of the key elements to consider is knowing your target audience. That includes the country, age, occupation, income, status  etc. There is no such thing as "The website is for everyone." The better you know your audience, the more success the website will have.

It's also important to know the reason why the target audience is visiting the website, what motivates them, what specific goals they have in mind. 

Once you collected the info and created fictitious user-profiles, it's time to do the overall layout or a site map. A simple sketch, also known as wireframing will help to see the future website without putting too much work into it. It will also ensure that all information needed is included. Wireframing can be done on paper and shouldn't include any colors, images, backgrounds, etc.

Remember, that most users don't read entire webpages. To get the most important point across you can use visual contrast, grouping, images, or headings.

Overall, the content of the webpage needs to be concise, clear, selective, interactive, and consistent. 

## Structure

Html pages all have very similar structure. It consists of several elements. Each element has an opening and a closing tag. (<>content</>).

ex: \<h2>content\</h2>

 The largest tags of every page are \<html>, \<header>,  \<body>, \<main>, and \<footer>. Inside the body various tags can be located. Additional attributes (consisting of a name and a value) can be positioned on the opening tag to provide additional information about the content.

ex: \<p lang="en-us">content\</p>


## HTML 5 layout

HTML 5 introduced a new set of elements for dividing the page. For example, the header sits inside a new \<header> element. The navigation is inside the \<nav>,and the articles are inside the \<article> elements.
